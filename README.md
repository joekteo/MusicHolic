MusicHolic
==========
MusicHolic is an iOS application that takes in audio from your mobile device and identifies the artist and song name. The only twist is that a drink is suggested along with your search! Enjoy using this anywhere, from the comforts of your home or even at a bar with friends/strangers!

<b>Pro-tip:</b> Drink selections are based off of a simple algorithm and may not 100% accurately represent its companion song! This will improve over time.

This repository contains the back-end (server) of the application and is Joe K. Teo <i>(https://github.com/joekteo)</i> and Simon Kim's <i>(https://github.com/simon-kim)</i> midterm project at Code Fellows. It was created using Node.js, Express, and MongoDB.

The iOS portion was covered by Jeff Chavez <i>(https://github.com/jeffChavez)</i> and Parker Lewis <i>(https://github.com/pakalewis)</i> and can be found at <i>https://github.com/jeffChavez/Musicholic-v2.</i>

The application was created with the help of the Gracenote and Echo Nest API.
